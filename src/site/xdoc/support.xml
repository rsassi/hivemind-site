            Below is a list of companies and consultants who provide commercial support, 
            in one form or another, for Tapestry. Being mentioned here is not an indication 
            of official "endorsement" by the Apache Software Foundation, but is instead 
            provided as a public service. This list is in no way a complete listing of the 
            many organizations providing either free or for cost support for ASF projects. 
            If you would like to be added to this list, or removed, please send a message to
            the <a href="mail-lists.html">dev mailing list</a>.
